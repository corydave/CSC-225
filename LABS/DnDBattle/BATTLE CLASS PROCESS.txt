Battle(Character char1, Character char2)

Each TURN will:

Maybe, maybe not call invokeSpecial() on char1 
Maybe, maybe not call invokeSpecial() on char2

char1 will attack char2 while char2 defends
Check to see if char2 has health < 0 - if true, game over

char2 will attack char1 while char1 defends
Check to see if char1 has health < 0 - if true, game over

return [winner, loser]



invokeSpecial() needs to be added!!!!!
attack/defend?
