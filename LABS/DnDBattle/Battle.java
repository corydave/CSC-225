   * . 5 - The battle is over if the health of the second player is 0 or below
   *   6 - The second player will attack the first player
   *   7 - The battle is over if the health of the first player is 0 or below

   *   The battle will repeat until a health check returns 0 or below.
   * 
   *   An array (of size 2) will be returned, index 0 contains the winner and 
   *   index 1 contains the loser.
   *
   * The vital stats for each character will be collected, stored into an array, and sent to 
   * the opposing Character. That is, there is a method called getOppInfo(Character)
   * that will be called by each of the Characters in the Battle class.
   *
   * The array will be of type int and have the following structure:
   *       [currentHealth, maxHealth, strength, defense, special, points]
